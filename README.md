# Beegarden Static Website
Beegarden is a static website make for review all bases about html css, to introduce CDA formation at [Elan Formation](https://elan-formation.fr/accueil)

## Structure
I try to have a great structure of my html file for accessibility and SEO

## Responsive
I just make mobile view with desktop, because i don't need to waste more time for this exercice, it's just prepare other exercices.
I import my "_mobile.css" file in html because the import rule at css doesn't work in my case
